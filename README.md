## Testing

### Responsiveness

The functionality of the links in the website was checked as well by
different users. The website was checked by extension
“**Responsive Viewer**” in Chrome.

Screen sizes

### Validator testing

#### HTML

- **Home page**
    
    ![Home page w3c testing](documentation/html-css-validator/index-7-mist.jpg)

When I tested the homepage using the [validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org/) service, it initially found seven errors. I fixed all of them, and a retest showed zero errors. Here's a screenshot proving the clean results.

![Home page w3c testing 1](documentation/html-css-validator/index-no-mist.jpg)

- **Learn page**
    
    ![Learn page w3c testing](documentation/html-css-validator/learn-1-m-expl.jpg)
    

The validator flagged an error on the learning page stating that the image element had an empty 'src' attribute. However, this is not a practical issue because JavaScript dynamically populates the 'src' attribute during the user's interaction with the page. This ensures that while the initial HTML might show an empty 'src', it is filled with the appropriate content as soon as the page is used. A screenshot from the live site demonstrates that during actual usage, all necessary image data is correctly loaded by JavaScript.

![Learn page w3c testing 1](documentation/html-css-validator/learn-1-m-expl.jpg)

- **Guess the country page**
    
    ![Guess the country page w3c testing](documentation/html-css-validator/guess-country-1-m.jpg)
    

Similarly, the "Guess the Country" game page has the same issue flagged by the validator regarding the image element having an empty 'src' attribute. This is also not a concern in practice because JavaScript dynamically fills in these attributes during gameplay. This ensures the images are correctly displayed when needed, as the game interacts with user inputs to load and display the corresponding flag images.

![Guess the country page w3c testing 1](documentation/html-css-validator/guess-country-1-m-expl.jpg)

- **Guess the flag page**
    
    ![Guess the flag page w3c testing](documentation/html-css-validator/guess-flag-3-m.jpg)
    

On the "Guess the Flag" game page, I found three issues, similar to previous scenarios. After adding a missing closing div tag, one issue remained.

![Guess the flag page w3c testing 1](documentation/html-css-validator/guess-flag-1-m.jpg)

This remaining issue is not a real error, as the country name is dynamically inserted when the page loads through a JavaScript function. Like in the other game pages, this setup ensures that all necessary data is correctly populated during user interaction, demonstrating that the HTML validator's error doesn't impact the actual functionality or user experience of the page.

![Guess the flag page Result page 2](documentation/html-css-validator/guess-flag-1-m-expl.jpg)

- **Result page**

No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official
W3C validator.

![Result page Result page](documentation/html-css-validator/result-w3.jpg)

#### CSS

No errors or warnings were found when passing through the official
W3C validator.

![w3c css testing](documentation/html-css-validator/css-w3.jpg)

#### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com/) to validate all of my JS files.

**quotes.js**

assets/js/quotes.js

![quotes-js.jpg](documentation/tests-js/quotes-js.jpg)

**learn.js**

assets/js/learn.js

![learn-jshint.jpg](documentation/tests-js/learn-jshint.jpg)

**guess-the-country.js**

assets/js/guess-the-country.js

![guess-the-country-jshint.jpg](documentation/tests-js/guess-the-country-jshint.jpg)

**guess-the-flag.js**

assets/js/guess-the-flag.js

![guess-the-flag-jshint.jpg](documentation/tests-js/guess-the-flag-jshint.jpg)

**result.js**

assets/js/result.js

![result-jshint.jpg](documentation/tests-js/result-jshint.jpg)

Although JSHint flagged "playAgain" as an unused variable on line 84, it's actually a function intended for restarting the game after displaying the result. It's used to allow the user to restart the game after completion, depending on the current game type.

Validating "flags-data.js" with JSHint is unnecessary since it only contains an array of flag objects. It includes properties such as "image" for the flag image path, "country" for the country name, "description" for information about the country, and "difficulty" to indicate the level of difficulty associated with the flag.

### Bugs

**learn.js**

assets/js/learn.js

**Duplicate Image Source Assignment:** The flag image source (**`src`**) was set twice in succession, which could lead to redundant operations or potential confusion in maintenance.

![bug01.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug01.jpg)

**Solution:** Remove the duplicate line to streamline the code and prevent any possible conflicts or performance issues.

![bug01-solution.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug01-solution.jpg)

The function **`showPreviousFlag()`** initially allowed the **`currentIndex`** to go negative if it was called when the **`currentIndex`** was **`0`**. This caused an out-of-bounds error when attempting to access the **`flagsDataArray`**.

![bug02.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug02.jpg)

**Solution Applied:** Revised the calculation for **`currentIndex`** to use modulo operation, ensuring that the wrap-around is handled more efficiently and preventing any negative indices. This modification ensures that **`currentIndex`** remains within the valid range, preventing errors and improving the robustness of the navigation through the flag array.

![bug02-solution.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug02-solution.jpg)

**guess-the-country.js**

assets/js/guess-the-country.js

Initially, the **`generateQuestionsArray`** function had a bug where it could sometimes add duplicate countries as options for a single question. This was because the check to prevent duplication only occurred within the same question and did not consider the entire set of selected flags.

![bug03.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug03.jpg)

**Solution Applied:**

To ensure uniqueness across the entire set of questions and options, a global set of used countries was implemented. This prevented the repeated use of the same country within different questions' options. 

![bug03-solution.jpg](documentation/bugs/bug03-solution.jpg)

This approach effectively resolves the issue by ensuring that each question's options are unique not only within themselves but also across the quiz, enhancing the quiz's quality and challenge.

### Unsolved Bugs

To the best of my knowledge, there are no unresolved bugs at the
moment.

### Mistakes

- Initially, failed to document encountered bugs promptly during the
coding process.
- Realised the importance of documenting bugs in real-time for better
tracking and resolution.
- In future projects, I commit to maintaining a detailed log of
encountered bugs and their resolution steps throughout the development
process.
- Initially, I attempted to implement automated tests using Jest. However, I realized that it would require much more time than I have left before the project deadline (which is tomorrow!). Therefore, I have decided to postpone this feature to my future projects.

### Content

1. **Flag’s images:**
    
    I took flag images from [Flagpedia.net](https://flagpedia.net/)
    
2. **General Information:**
    - Additional information about countries is
    referenced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/).

3. **Some design:**
    - The design of the buttons on the main page was [borrowed](https://codepen.io/andrea-maselli.) but extensively modified to fit my project.

## Acknowledgments

- My daughter for her longstanding love of flags and all things related to them.
  
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) for his amazing CSS tutorials.
  
- A heartfelt thank you to the creators of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for providing an
excellent style framework. Their toolkit not only accelerates the
development process but also empowers beginners to exceed their own
capabilities.

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more flags:** Expand the collection of flags to include more countries.
2. **Enhance interactivity:** Incorporate sound effects when buttons are clicked.
3. **Visual feedback in games:** Implement highlighting of incorrect answers in red and correct answers in green to provide immediate feedback to the user during gameplay.
4. **Review of incorrect answers:** Provide a link on the results page where users can review the questions they answered incorrectly and practice those specific flags or country associations.
5. **Voice narration:** Introduce voice narration for text content and flag descriptions on the learning page to enhance accessibility and cater to users with different needs.
6. **Include historical context:** Add information about the history and symbolism of flags, explaining the meaning behind their colors and symbols.
7. **Difficulty levels:** Introduce a feature to allow users to select the difficulty level before starting the game, offering options such as easy, medium, and hard.
